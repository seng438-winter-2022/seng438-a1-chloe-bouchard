# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

In this lab, we are testing a software using different testing approaches to find defects. The testing approaches include exploratory testing, manual scripted testing, and regression testing. By testing a software ATM system, we will apply these testing approaches in order to get more familiar with software testing as well as a bug tracking system called Backlog.

Before this lab, we were aware that exploratory testing was a form of unscripted testing where the test are designed and executed at the same time. The idea of exploratory testing is to create "realistic" scenarios and using those scenarios to test the software. This approach is human based and can test simple functionalities or large sets of sequences. In contrast, manual functional testing is a scripted testing approach that is usually written by the tester themselves. This form of testing follows a specific path and there is no deviation from this path.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
    
When actually testing the ATM using both exploratory and manual functional testing, we can see that they are completely different in their approach. Exploratory testing felt very unstructured and was not guided. Therefore, testers were able to use the ATM properly or try odd sequences of inputs in order to find bugs in unique ways. Manual functional testing was very guided and strict in terms of what inputs you could use. The ATM would need to be in a very specific state before you could test certain inputs. Any deviation from this structure would make the initial system state to be tested to be incorrect.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Team work during each part of the lab was split evenly in between each group member. Each group member spent about 30 minutes doing exploratory testing on the the ATM system and recorded any defects to Backlog. Manual functional testing was split evenly between group member, where each group member would handle 10 test cases in Appendix C. Similarly for regression testing, each group member went over the bugs they found during manual functional testing in version 1.1 of the ATM system.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

During this lab, some group members found it difficult to remember the sequences it took to reach a bug, specifically during exploratory testing. This was easily overcome by
examining the ATMs log and by listing the sequence of events taken as the tester navigates the system. It was also somewhat challenging to get familiar with Backlog, but this was overcome as we began to record our bug reports over time. During exploratory testing, it was tough to not list duplicate reports as some group members were finding the same defects as other group members. In order to prevent duplicate reports, we learned to search through our bug reports before posting any new reports.
